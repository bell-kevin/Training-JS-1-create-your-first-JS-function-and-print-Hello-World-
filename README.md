# Training-JS-1-create-your-first-JS-function-and-print-Hello-World-
In JavaScript, your code is running in a function, let us step by step complete your first JS function.  Look at this example:        --------keyword "function"       |       ----your function name         |       |    ---if needed, some arguments will appear in brackets       |       |    |     function myfunc(){  ---------your function code will starting with "{"       //you should type your code here     }----------------------------ending with "}" If we want to print some to the screen, maybe we can use Document.write() in the web, or use alert() pop your message, but Codewars did not support these methods, we should use console.log() in your function. see this example:  function printWordToScreen(){   var somewords="This is an example."   console.log(somewords) } If we run this function, This is an example. will be seen on the screen. As you see, console.log() is an useful method help your work, you will become more and more like it.  Task Please refer to two example above and write your first JS function.  mission 1:  use keyword function to define your function, function name should be helloWorld(don't forget the () and {})  mission 2:  use keyword var (or let or const) to define a variable str, value of str should be a string: "Hello World!"(don't forget the =).  mission 3:  type the console.log() in the next line(don't forget to put the str in the brackets).  When you have finished the work, click "Run Tests" to see if your code is working properly.  In the end, click "Submit" to submit your code pass this kata.


== We're Using GitHub Under Protest ==

This project is currently hosted on GitHub.  This is not ideal; GitHub is a
proprietary, trade-secret system that is not Free and Open Souce Software
(FOSS).  We are deeply concerned about using a proprietary system like GitHub
to develop our FOSS project.  We have an
[open {bug ticket, mailing list thread, etc.} ](INSERT_LINK) where the
project contributors are actively discussing how we can move away from GitHub
in the long term.  We urge you to read about the
[Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign from
[the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) to understand
some of the reasons why GitHub is not a good place to host FOSS projects.

If you are a contributor who personally has already quit using GitHub, please
[check this resource](INSERT_LINK) for how to send us contributions without
using GitHub directly.

Any use of this project's code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done
without our permission.  We do not consent to GitHub's use of this project's
code in Copilot.
